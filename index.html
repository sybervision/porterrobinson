                Porter Robinson rocketed to stardom as a teenage EDM producer before his music evolved into an ambitious, introspective
                form of futuristic electropop. He first reached mainstream chart success with vibrant electro-house tracks like 2012's
                "Language," a U.K. Top Ten hit.

                    Growing up in the sleepy town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Porter began producing music at the tender age of 13,
                     having caught the bug from Dance Dance Revolution. Fast forward several years later, 
                     and releases such as “Say My Name” were quickly attracting attention from all the right places.

                    "Look at the Sky" builds off these last three
                    videos, with Robinson now in the "studio" of his
                    mind. He's surrounded by these cloaked figures,
                    aiding him in the creation of the single. These
                    figures were actually shown in "Mirror" as
                    guides and now have taken physical form. This
                    type of artistry is genius and proves we are
                    witnessing Robinson at the top of his game.

                    He continues, "the "Look at the Sky" video is about
                    the beauty I find in this cycle. where the meaning
                    of the song is more directly about the value of
                    hope and resilience in the face of despair, with the
                    video, i wanted to extend the idea of 'being alive
                    next year' from being literal into being a metaphor
                    about the things we can contribute to this
                    world that will outlast us."
